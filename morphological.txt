Experiment No. 2

Morphological Analysis Aim:

The aim of the practical is to conduct morphological analysis to understand and analyze the structure of linguistic forms.

Lab Objectives:

To apply and demonstrate the basics of morphological analysis for word formation.

Theory: a Morphology analysis is a linguistic study that deals with the internal structure of words in Language. It explores how words are formed from smaller meaningful units called morphenes. Morphemes are the smallest grammatical units in a language that carry meaning.

Here are the key components and concepts of morphology analysis:

Morphene:

As mentioned earlier, a morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning in a language. It can be a word itself or a part of a word (prefixes, suffixes, etc.). For example, in the word "unhappiness, there are three morphenes: "un-"(meaning 'not'), "happy" (meaning 'joyful'), and"-ness" (indicating a state or quality).

Free and Bound Morphenes:

Free morphenes can stand alone as words by themselves and carry meaning. For example, English, words like "dog," "run," and "book" are free morphemes.

in

can't stand alone and must be attached to other morphemes to convey meaning. Bound morphenes ca Prefixes like "un-" or suffixes like "-ed" are examples.

Inflectional Derivational Morphemes:

Inflectional morphenes alter the form of a word to indicate grammatical information like tense,

case, e, number, etc. For example, in English, "-s" in "cats" indicates plural. Derivational morpheres are used to create new words or change the grammatical category of a word. For example, adding "-ness" to "happy" creates "happiness, changing an adjective to a noun.

Morphological Processes:

example, adding -ing" to "read" forms "reading."

Affixation: This involves adding prefixes (before the root) or suffixes (after the root) Lo a word. Far

Compounding: It involves combining two or more free morphemes to create a new word. For instance, blackboard" combines ines "black" and "board."

Reduplication: This process involves repeating a morpheme or part of it to create a new word. For example, in Tagalog, "tawa" (laugh) becomes "tatawa" (will laugh).

Blending: This involves combining parts of two words to create a new one, often through truncation or fusion. For example, "brunch" combines "breakfast" and "lunch."

Conversion (Zero Derivation): This is a process where a word changes its grammatical category without any overt morphological change. For example, "to google" (verb) from the proper noun "Google."

Allomorphy: This refers to the variation in pronunciation of a morpheme depending on its context. For example, the plural morpheme in English can be pronounced as/s/ (cats) or/z/ (dogs) depending on the preceding sound.

Lab Outcome:

Apply and demonstra the basics of morphological analysis for word formation.

Conclusions:

In conclusion, Morphological Analysis proves its worth as a valuable and versatile tool with applications in diverse fields. Its systematic approach to breaking down complex systems facilitates

comprehensive understanding, aiding in problem-solving, decision-making, and system optimization. By dissecting the morphology of entities, this method offers a structured approach, fostering creativity and efficiency in engineering, decision science, strategic planning, and beyond. Its adaptability makes Morphological Analysis a valuable asset for addressing multifaceted challenges across various disciplines.
