Title: Interactions

Experiment No 4

Ain: 4.1 Create an interactive dashboard with text and visual tooltips by using drill-down 4.2 Interactivity with text and visual tooltips, Interactivity with actions (filter, highlight, URL), Drilldown between dashboards

Lab Objective: To build an interactive dashboard with text and visual tooltips, supporting actions like filtering and drill-down navigation between dashboards, enhancing the user experience and data exploration.

Theory: 4.1

Creating an interactive dashboard with text and visual tooltips using a drill-down approach involves designing a dynamic data visualization interface that enables users to explore information In a hierarchical manner. It typically connences with a high-level overview, presenting sunnary statistics or key performance indicators (KPIs) to offer users a top-level perspective of the data.

these elenents to access more detailed information High-Level Overview: Start with a high-level view the data, such as summary statistics or key performance indicators (KPIs). This provides users with a bird's-eye view of the infornation. Interactive Elements: Design the dashboard with interactive elements, such as clickable charts, graphs, or data points. Users can click Text and Visual Tooltips: Implement tooltips that display relevant information when a user hovers over or clicks on a specific data point. Tooltips can include text descriptions, additional statistics, even visual aids like pop-up charts.

Interactivity with Text and Visual Tooltips:

Interactivity with text and visual tooltips is a critical feature in data visualization and dashboard design. It involves providing users with additional information and context by allowing then to hover over or click on data points, charts, or other elements within a dashicard.

Interactivity with Actions (Filter, Highlight, URL):

Interactivity with actions in a dashboard allows users to manipulate and interact with the data to extract meaningful insights and perform specific tasks. This includes features like filtering, highlighting, and linking to external resources through URLS.

1. Filtering: Users can apply filters to the data to narrow down what they are viewing. focusing on specific subsets or timeframes. Filters enable users to customize their data analysis and answer specific questions. For example, in an e-commerce dashboard, users night filter sales data to viea results for a particular product category or location.

2. Highlighting: Highlighting lets users enphasize particular data points, making it easier to identity trends, outliers, or important information. It is a valuable tool for visual data analysis and storytelling within the dashboard.

3. URL Links: Incorporating URL links allows users to access external resources or websites directly from the dashboard. For instance, a dashboard tracking news articles can link to the full articles or related web pages for additional context and information. These interactive actions enpower users to interact with the data and customize their experience, making the dashboard a versatile tool for data exploration, analysis, and decision-making.

Lab Outcome

The lab outcome suggests that using interacti dashboard with text and visual tooltips in a drill-down approach enhances data exploration and insight generation, providing a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making

Conclusion:

In conclusion, creating an interactive dashboard with text and visual tooltips us in a drill-down approach involves steps such as providing a high-level overview, adding interactive elements, text and visual tooltips, and a hierarchical structure. It aims empower users to explore data, maintain data consistency, and gain valuable insights for makin informed decisions.
